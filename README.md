# MobileIE

This repository contains the official implementation for ICCV 2025 paper:

[MobileIE: An Extremely Lightweight and Effective ConvNet for Real-Time Image Enhancement on Mobile Devices][[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01838)

### Preparation

1. Replace the dataset path in the config file.
2. If you want to train the model, set the type in config to "original" and need_slims to "false".
3. If you want to test the pretrain model, set the type in config to "re-parameterized", need_slims to "true", and load the re-parameterized pre-trained model. You can also run inference with TFLite model by executing "test_TFlite.py".
4. You can use the TFLite model and import it into AI Benchmark (https://ai-benchmark.com/) to obtain the inference speed on mobile devices.

### Train

```bash
python main.py -task train -model_task lle -device cuda
```

### Test

```bash
python main.py -task test -model_task lle -device cuda
```

### Demo

```bash
python main.py -task demo -model_task lle -device cuda
```
